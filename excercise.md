# Exercise

##Exercise: ft_rotate_matrix
Allowed functions: None

Write a C program to rotate a NxN matrix 90 degrees. The program should read each element of the matrix from user input and then rotate the matrix in anti-clockwise direction.

For instance, if you have the 3x3 matrix:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
It should be rotated to:
```
3 6 9
2 5 8
1 4 7
```
Hereâ€™s how it should be prototyped :
`void ft_rotate_matrix(int **matrix, int n);`

The function should keep rotating the matrix until a complete 360-degree rotation is achieved.

Please ensure the output of the matrix after every 90-degree rotation is printed to the console.
